## Sample code solutions to some problems (with a unit test project)
  
### This repo contains solutions to three problems:

1. Determine whether a string has any duplicate characters.

2. For any numbers n and m, where n <= m and n >= 0, write methods that calculate the consecutive range from n to m, as well as the range of odd and even numbers from n to m. Avoid looping if possible.

3. Write an efficient search method that can determine whether an ordered list of strings contains a given string.

### Testing the solutions

You should be able to run this console application, and its tests, on either Mac or Windows, assuming you have the .NET Core SDK. To run the tests using in the CLI, navigate to the solution's base directory and run the following command:

``` dotnet test```
