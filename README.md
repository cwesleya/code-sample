## Sample code solutions to some problems (with a unit test project)
  
### This repo contains solutions to three problems:

1. Determine whether a string has any duplicate characters.

2. For any numbers n and m, where n <= m and n >= 0, write methods that calculate the consecutive range from n to m, as well as the range of odd and even numbers from n to m. Avoid looping if possible.

3. Write an efficient search method that can determine whether an ordered list of strings contains a given string.

### Testing the solutions

This .NET Core console application should run in Mac or Windows. To run the tests in the CLI, navigate to the solution's base directory and run this command:

``` dotnet test```
